		<h1>Uncertainty Types</h1>
		<p>
			Uncertainties of geographical data can belong to basic three types
			(Longley et al. 2010). The first is the <em>uncertainty of
				location data</em>, also known as positional uncertainty. An example
			would be, not knowing the exact location of a geographic feature, a
			tree. The second is the <em>uncertainty in attribute data</em>, also
			known as attribute uncertainty. Attribute uncertainty can be
			expressed for an example, as the inexactness of the temperature for a
			given area. Thirdly, what is known as <em>temporal uncertainty</em>
			is the inexactness of the temporal dimension of events that occur and
			vary through time.
